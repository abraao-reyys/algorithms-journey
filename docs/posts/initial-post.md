At a given moment, before I even entered university, I realized that what I would learn there would not be enough. Therefore, I started looking for alternative ways to learn more.

In this moment, I started writing this kind of blog to take notes on the content I learned and complete exercises to better retain the content.

Oh, of course. I'm writing in English so I can take advantage of this oportunity and to practice the language.
